# RandomForestClassfier

I have created an application which takes train data (to train the model), test data (to make predictions on) and sample submissions (since it is given in every kaggle competition) as the inputs, and gives output in the form of predictions it made on test data. The applications does all the needful things which includes filling missing values, encoding categorical attributes, dropping unneccessary columns and much more. I'm open for all types of suggestions and reviews, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
